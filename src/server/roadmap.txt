FEATURE: during signup user creates a stable (at least one). HRC field is added to every entry in db
for each stable there are two types of access: manager and guest. Manager can edit everything, guest can view calendar only
manager access level requires sign-in, guest access for diary requires hash link
Each account owner can send a invitation for other acc owner to manage his stable (give full access to db resources).
After sign-in there's a modal showing stables you would like to pick
Via admin panel you can edit HRC add users, create new HRC for account, delete

FEATURE: allow for different presentation of each DayPlan (and corresDairy) depending on presentation type param
 (as it is now / or each trainingDetails should have trainer column)

Backend
- add error codes
0) token/cookies to keep ws alive
1) timeout in asyncWhile does not work (?)
2) add commons for typings (mess around with package.json)
3) IP limits (request dependent)

    ----later on----
    2) possibly some users would like to set different workload for different horses - it is doable, tho not that easy
    2a) allow different time resolutions (like 30 or 45 minutes rides etc)
    2c) adding a flag to calculation if exhausting search is expected (may not be good for AWS EC2 where CPU credits are calculated)
    3) change db scheme - horses and kidos are assigned to 'User' and 'RidingSchool'. after login user selects the ridingSchool for which he/she will be defining query
    4) create log parsing script, and reply parsing script move tableHelper to src then
    5) add handling of new_user/edit_user/remove_user messages
    6) conformation email handling when registering
