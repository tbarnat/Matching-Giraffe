MOST RECENT TODOS:

FEATURE: when day is saved it is not editable, as it should
BUG: link is not sharable
BUG: when removing content from Kid typeahead field on DayPlan the field disappears
FEATURE: validation (each hour should be last + 100)
FEATURE: login
FEATURE: each trainingDetails should have trainer column

Backend
- add error codes
0) token/cookies to keep ws alive
1) timeout in asyncWhile does not work (?)
2) add commons for typings (mess around with package.json)
3) IP limits (request dependent)

    ----later on----
    2) possibly some users would like to set different workload for different horses - it is doable, tho not that easy
    2a) allow different time resolutions (like 30 or 45 minutes rides etc)
    2c) adding a flag to calculation if exhausting search is expected (may not be good for AWS EC2 where CPU credits are calculated)
    3) change db scheme - horses and kidos are assigned to 'User' and 'RidingSchool'. after login user selects the ridingSchool for which he/she will be defining query
    4) create log parsing script, and reply parsing script move tableHelper to src then
    5) add handling of new_user/edit_user/remove_user messages
    6) conformation email handling when registering

WS frn-bck
1) is there any reason to disconnect client (?)

Frontend
 correct interfaces in DayPlan
 validation on fields, excluded horses etc..
 login
 register/create account (with conformation email)
 languages (all fields as labels)
1) sharing saved days via facebook/ twitter (?)
2) assetStats (how popular are each horses)
