Backend

0) token/cookies to keep ws alive
1) timeout in asyncWhile does not work (?)
2) add commons for typings (mess around with package.json)
3) api limits (request dependent)

    ----later on----
    2) possibly some users would like to set different workload for different horses - it is doable, tho not that easy
    2a) allow different time resolutions (like 30 or 45 minutes rides etc)
    2c) adding a flag to calculation if exhausting search is expected (may not be good for AWS EC2 where CPU credits are calculated)
    3) change db scheme - horses and kidos are assigned to 'User' and 'RidingSchool'. after login user selects the ridingSchool for which he/she will be defining query
    4) create log parsing script, and reply parsing script move tableHelper to src then
    5) add handling of new_user/edit_user/remove_user messages
    6) conformation email handling when registering

WS frn-bck
1) is there any reason to disconnect client (?)

Frontend
1) create api description with interfaces
2) maxWorkload
2) default trainer for user (?)
